# Stable Fluids (Stam, 1999) - p5.js Implementation

This project implements Jos Stam's "Stable Fluids" algorithm in JavaScript using p5.js. The simulation demonstrates real-time fluid dynamics with interactive mouse input and color toggling.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file to load the simulation.
- `sketch.js`: Core simulation and rendering logic.
- `fluid.js`: (If present) Additional fluid solver utilities.
- `ui.js`: (If present) UI controls and event handling.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. Use the mouse to interact with the fluid. Toggle color mode if the UI is present.
